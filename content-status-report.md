# Socrat: current content status and complete inventory

**Snapshot:** 2026-10-23T23:27:20+05:30 (Asia/Calcutta). **Branch:** `content/syllabus-expansion`. **Inspected commit:** `c2af5b4bd9d12959ec691e7e36b134b6865114d8`.

This report inventories the checked-out repository and its existing generated test cache. It does not measure a deployed production database, student-generated content, private uploads or external websites. Counts below come from files and the executable catalog schema, not older roadmap totals. No course content was edited or downloaded for this audit.

The companion [complete CSV inventory](<D:/Socrat/content-inventory.csv>) contains **17,661 records**, including every external problem, implementation link, local lesson/quiz/problem/atom, lesson section, book reference, additional resource and company index. These are different record types and include nested sections and link mappings; **do not treat their combined row count as a number of independent lessons**.

## 1. What actually exists

| Layer | Quantity | What the quantity means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Courses | 3 | Programming from Zero; DSA for Interviews; Competitive Programming |
| Modules / subject areas | 19 | Authored groups inside courses |
| Concepts / taught topics | 74 | One local YAML lesson per concept |
| Lesson sections / subtopics | 992 | Actual Markdown headings, including recurring walkthrough/check headings; not separate lesson files |
| Lesson text size | 97,688 whitespace words | Includes code/Markdown tokens; not a pure-prose reading-time estimate |
| Prerequisite edges | 114 | Includes cross-course bridges |
| Local concept quiz items | 390 | One reusable bank; not an additional bank per placement/review/assessment mode |
| Local judge problems | 138 | Full statements, examples, hints, Python references and generators stored locally |
| Generated judge test cases | 1575 | Cached cases for the 138 problems, not new exercises |
| Released teaching-atom packs | 30 | 30 of 74 concepts; all have recorded release/review metadata |
| Teaching-atom instances | 279 | 279 instances; repeated/template bodies occur across packs |
| Checks inside atoms | 107 | Separate authored interactive steps, not added to the 390 concept-quiz count |
| Curated course-resource mappings | 250 | 165 exact unique URLs; external links, not stored articles/videos |
| Authored external practice mappings | 255 | 219 exact unique URLs; can overlap the imported practice index |
| Imported external problem records | 13889 | Metadata/links only; no local statement/editorial/solution corpus |
| Reference implementation links | 538 | TheAlgorithms links; not 538 locally stored code lessons |
| Company groups | 637 | Company/problem frequency metadata, not company-authored courses |
| Company/problem associations | 16933 | Many-to-many; not extra distinct problems |
| Additional roadmap-link mappings | 115 | Developer Roadmap metadata/links |
| Additional Python exercise mappings | 35 | Links/guidance; external exercise text not stored here |
| Handbook references | 47 | One externally linked book, mapped to 39 concepts |
| Controlled misconception IDs | 274 | Repair taxonomy, not standalone lessons |
| Problem drafts in content/drafts | 0 | Directory currently has its workflow README only |

**Hierarchy used in this report:** course → authored module (subject area) → concept (topic) → lesson heading (subtopic/section). The current schema does not define a separate universal subject/subtopic taxonomy. Python, C++ and Java are supported languages of the same courses; they are not three copies of each curriculum. Course prose is English; no separate translated course tree is present.

**Important distinction:** the active catalog has 138 locally judgeable authored problems and 13,889 external problem links. The links expand practice selection, but do not supply 13,889 local explanations, answer keys, hidden-test suites or independently calibrated assessment items.

## 2. Course totals and quantity definitions

| Course | Version | Modules | Concepts | Lesson words | Quiz items | Local problems | Atoms | Atom-pack coverage | External unique mapped | External primary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Programming from Zero | 1.0.1 | 5 | 18 | 11894 | 98 | 39 | 93 | 10/18 | 1523 | 329 |
| DSA for Interviews | 1.0.0 | 7 | 36 | 74127 | 213 | 71 | 93 | 10/36 | 6268 | 4575 |
| Competitive Programming | 1.0.0 | 7 | 20 | 11667 | 79 | 28 | 93 | 10/20 | 11287 | 8985 |

`External unique mapped` counts a problem once within that course if any of its up-to-three concept mappings belongs to the course. `External primary` uses only its first concept and partitions the global bank. External counts across concepts/modules/courses overlap; their sum is not the unique global count. Local problem totals use unique IDs; one concept (`zero:scope-and-mutation`) has no linked native problem.

| Course | Owned estimated learning minutes | Full prerequisite closure | Cross-course concepts in closure | Language support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Programming from Zero | 750 | 18 | none | python, cpp, java |
| DSA for Interviews | 2285 | 52 | zero: 16 | python, cpp, java |
| Competitive Programming | 1045 | 55 | dsa: 19, zero: 16 | python, cpp, java |

Estimated learning minutes are authored concept estimates that include learning/practice intent. They are not measured completion times or the runtime planner's promise for any learner. Prerequisite closure adds existing concepts from other courses rather than creating more owned lessons.

### Local text volume by course

| Course | Lesson words | Quiz-prompt words | Native-statement words | Hint words | Solution-approach words | Atom-body words (instances) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Programming from Zero | 11894 | 998 | 1636 | 1847 | 1402 | 1913 |
| DSA for Interviews | 74127 | 2674 | 3293 | 4321 | 3620 | 2008 |
| Competitive Programming | 11667 | 944 | 1036 | 1571 | 1033 | 2009 |

These are separate field-level text measurements, not an additive unique-word corpus: atom templates repeat, quizzes can refer to code outside their prompt, and lessons include Markdown/code. Reference/generator code and test input/output bytes are not counted as explanatory prose. Every lesson section below has its own body word count; inclusive counts overlap when headings nest.

## 3. Storage, sources, provenance and current serving behavior

| Content type | Stored where | Stored body or link? | Source / review evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Courses/modules/lessons/quizzes | `content/courses/<course>/course.yaml` and `concepts/*.yaml` | Local curriculum/lesson/code/quiz bodies | No per-lesson/per-quiz author, license or review field in active schema; linked reading is not proof of where the prose originated |
| Native problems | `content/courses/<course>/problems/*.yaml` | Local statements, examples, hints, references/generators | 2/138 have explicit review blocks; the other 136 have no review block in current files, which does not prove whether review happened elsewhere |
| Teaching atoms | `content/atoms/<course>/<concept>.yaml` | Local teaching/check/code bodies | All 30 packs declare original Socrat examples, owner Socrat learning content, status released, review by Owner on 2026-10-13; declarations are recorded evidence, not an independent rights audit |
| Curated reading/video/docs/visualizers | concept.resources | Titles, URLs, type, duration, level/language | Publisher labels exist; item licenses, robots snapshots, fetch timestamps and content hashes do not |
| External practice index | content/practice/problems.jsonl | Titles/URLs/tags/difficulty/ratings/company metadata | Aggregate source manifest has pinned Git revisions for several imports, but no per-record import timestamp or license evidence |
| Company metadata | content/practice/companies.json | Problem ID/frequency/recency associations | Importer reads snehasishroy company CSVs; no verification against employers in this audit |
| Implementation references | content/practice/implementations.jsonl | GitHub code-file links only | TheAlgorithms repository revisions pinned in URLs/manifest; importer describes MIT repos, not per-file proof |
| Book chapters | content/practice/book.json | External PDF/page links only | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (linked, not reproduced) (manifest declaration; not verified online) |
| Roadmap/exercise supplements | content/learning-resources.json | Metadata/links plus local short guidance | Roadmap URLs pin a revision; Python exercise links point at mutable master |
| Judge test cache | `.cache/content-tests/<problem>.json` + `.sha256` | Generated input/expected-output cases | 138 current caches match source YAML hashes; correctness was not re-executed in this audit |

The active loader is [services/api/src/socrat/catalog/registry.py](<D:/Socrat/services/api/src/socrat/catalog/registry.py>); authoring contracts are in [services/api/src/socrat/catalog/schema.py](<D:/Socrat/services/api/src/socrat/catalog/schema.py>) and [services/api/src/socrat/catalog/atoms.py](<D:/Socrat/services/api/src/socrat/catalog/atoms.py>). The report treats repository lessons/problems as stored authoring material; it does not infer that they were scraped from their recommended links. No tracked LICENSE/NOTICE file was found by the audit; that absence is not a legal conclusion about ownership.

**What learners can be served by current code:** normal concept views expose local lesson text, key points, pitfalls, native problems, filtered reading and external practice links. Resource ranking picks three preferred entries and returns the ranked list; implementations are filtered by learner language (default up to three), and handbook references are page links. Roadmap links appear in the course roadmap; extra exercises are language-filtered. Released atom packs are used by session composition. A concept without a pack still has its standard lesson and quiz, but the atom composer has no authored atom sequence for it. These are code-path observations, not a live deployment/UI audit.

**Assessment content is reused:** placement/review/checkpoint/assessment services draw from the concept quiz/native problem banks. No separate, independently calibrated unseen assessment corpus was identified. Schema validity and generated test counts do not establish independent-solve calibration or teaching quality.

### 3.2 Imported-source ledger

| Source | Role | Recorded revision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [liquidslr](<https://github.com/liquidslr/leetcode-company-wise-problems>) | LeetCode titles/topics/difficulty metadata | `03850eb5d16892514491cf1381c32ec0330a2719` |
| [companywise](<https://github.com/snehasishroy/leetcode-companywise-interview-questions>) | Company problem frequency and recency | `e095c259cfd036e3ddb6886e84d7075c2faac477` |
| [striver](<https://github.com/Codensity30/Strivers-A2Z-DSA-Sheet>) | Title matching to flag A2Z membership; 74 flagged problems, not a full imported A2Z course | `c42ee6ecac700e1171e99d2d3e2b0cb27c2f597d` |
| [thealgorithms-cpp](<https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C-Plus-Plus>) | 139 C++ implementation links | `fdcc29b0ac2848e9d1a8d926e171cc5b39f97759` |
| [thealgorithms-python](<https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python>) | 212 Python implementation links | `215c1f0710f610aaf5ebaeab04edacec3f5308cd` |
| [thealgorithms-java](<https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java>) | 187 Java implementation links | `5eb9d6634cfe84b1d53daf83187f8d11eca0bbb8` |

Other recorded import sources: Codeforces problemset API (`https://codeforces.com/api/problemset.problems`), CSES problemset index (`https://cses.fi/problemset/`), and [Developer Roadmap](<https://github.com/nilbuild/developer-roadmap>) at `8e62a35a8c113d9b52267046941b49f52e3f621e`. The exercise source is [zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises](<https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises/blob/master/100%2B%20Python%20challenging%20programming%20exercises%20for%20Python%203.md>).

`learning-resources.json` also records `anatomy_revision=e6600ffc4e8e6620eeb45bf49bcdbd5e4b84163f`, but 0 emitted supplement URLs reference that revision and every roadmap entry is labelled Developer Roadmap. Treat it as manifest metadata, not evidence of an additional imported course/book. The source manifest records takeuforward.org as excluded because of its automated-access policy; the A2Z flag comes from the GitHub title source. These are repository declarations, not fresh website/terms checks.

The older practice importer uses tag/section/title/filename rules and up to three concept matches. CSES difficulty uses section/solver heuristics, Codeforces labels use rating thresholds (easy ≤1200, medium ≤1700), and other library rating bands are software mappings. No per-problem pedagogical review, live difficulty calibration, or company-claim verification was found in these records. The practice importer predates Foundry and is not evidence that these links passed Foundry's newer domain/license/robots checks.

## 4. Complete course, module, topic and subtopic breakdown

In course tables, `Native` means concept-linked local judge problems; `EP` is imported external primary matches and `EA` all matches; `Impl P/C/J` counts Python/C++/Java implementation links. Zero means no record in that specific layer, not that the concept has no lesson. Lesson subtopics are actual authored heading labels; recurring pedagogical headings are included. `Own words` counts body text from that heading to the next heading, excluding its title; `Including children` extends to the next same/higher-level heading and can overlap child counts. Resources/quizzes/problems are mapped to concepts, not individual headings, so no per-section resource assignments are invented. All full individual links and local quiz prompts are also indexed in the CSV.

### 4.1 Programming from Zero — `zero`

A patient, practice-first path for complete beginners. You will learn how programs think, write and debug real code in Python, C++ or Java, and build the problem-solving habits every later skill depends on. No prior experience assumed.

**Course file:** [content/courses/zero/course.yaml](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/course.yaml>). **Version:** 1.0.1. **Languages:** python, cpp, java.

#### First steps — `first-steps`

What a program is, how it runs, and how it stores and computes values.

##### Programs and output — `zero:programs-and-output`

- **Scope:** A program is a precise list of instructions the computer runs top to bottom. Printing is how it talks back.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/programs-and-output.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/zero/programs-and-output.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** none
- **Key points:** A program runs its instructions in order, top to bottom.; Printing shows output; the order of print statements is the order of output.; Quotes make text (a string); without quotes, expressions are calculated.; Comments are ignored by the computer and explain code to people.
- **Pitfalls:** Forgetting the closing quote or bracket — the program will not run at all.; Expecting the computer to "understand what you meant". It does exactly what you wrote.
- **Local judge problems:** [Echo a reading](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/echo-reading.yaml>) (`echo-reading`, easy); [Print a ticket stub](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/ticket-stub.yaml>) (`ticket-stub`, easy)
- **Quiz items:** `order-of-output` (output, difficulty 1/5); `quotes-vs-math` (output, difficulty 1/5); `comment-ignored` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `precise-instructions` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `print-sep-end` (output, difficulty 4/5); `print-order` (output, difficulty 5/5)
- **Atoms:** `hook` (hook, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `concept` (concept, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `worked` (worked, 0 checks, adapters python,cpp,java); `faded` (faded, 1 checks, adapters neutral); `visualizer` (visualizer, 1 checks, adapters python,cpp,java); `micro` (micro, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `syntax-repair` (micro, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `pattern` (pattern, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `explanation` (explanation, 1 checks, adapters neutral)

##### Variables and types — `zero:variables-and-types`

- **Scope:** Variables are named boxes that hold values; every value has a type that decides what you can do with it.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/variables-and-types.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/zero/variables-and-types.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:programs-and-output`
- **Key points:** A variable is a named place that stores one value at a time.; `=` evaluates the right side, then stores the result on the left.; Every value has a type (whole number, decimal, text, true/false).; C++ and Java require declaring a variable's type; Python infers it.; Trace code by tracking each variable's value line by line.
- **Pitfalls:** Reading `x = x + 1` as a false equation instead of an update.; Using a variable before giving it a value.; Mixing text and numbers without converting (e.g. "5" + 3).

- **Atoms:** `hook` (hook, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `concept` (concept, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `worked` (worked, 0 checks, adapters python,cpp,java); `faded` (faded, 1 checks, adapters neutral); `visualizer` (visualizer, 1 checks, adapters python,cpp,java); `micro` (micro, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `syntax-repair` (micro, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `pattern` (pattern, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `explanation` (explanation, 1 checks, adapters neutral); `trace` (trace, 1 checks, adapters python,cpp,java); `predict` (predict, 1 checks, adapters python,cpp,java); `debug` (debug, 1 checks, adapters python,cpp,java)

##### Input and arithmetic — `zero:input-and-arithmetic`

- **Scope:** Read values the user gives your program, convert them to numbers, and compute with + - * / and remainder.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/input-and-arithmetic.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/zero/input-and-arithmetic.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:variables-and-types`
- **Key points:** Input arrives as text; convert it before doing arithmetic.; Whole-number division: `//` in Python, `/` between ints in C++ and Java.; `%` gives the remainder: great for even/odd, last digit and unit conversions.; Multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.
- **Pitfalls:** Forgetting to convert input in Python, then adding text instead of numbers.; Using `/` in Python when you wanted a whole number.; Integer overflow in C++/Java when results exceed about 2.1 billion.

#### Making decisions and repeating — `control-flow`

Branches and loops — the two ideas that make programs powerful.

##### Making decisions with if — `zero:conditionals`

- **Scope:** Use if, else if and else to run different code depending on the situation.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/conditionals.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/zero/conditionals.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:input-and-arithmetic`
- **Key points:** `if` runs a block only when its condition is true.; In an if / else-if / else chain, only the first true branch runs.; `==` compares; `=` assigns.; Test boundary values — exactly at each threshold.
- **Pitfalls:** Writing `=` instead of `==` inside a condition.; Putting a broad condition before a narrow one so the narrow branch never runs.; Forgetting braces (C++/Java) or indentation (Python), so the wrong lines are inside the if.
- **Local judge problems:** [Letter grade](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/grade-letter.yaml>) (`grade-letter`, easy); [Largest of three](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/max-of-three.yaml>) (`max-of-three`, easy); [Museum ticket price](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/museum-ticket.yaml>) (`museum-ticket`, easy)
- **Quiz items:** `first-true-branch` (output, difficulty 2/5); `equals-operator` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `boundary` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `else-meaning` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `elif-order` (output, difficulty 4/5); `dangling-if` (mcq, difficulty 5/5)
- **Atoms:** `hook` (hook, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `concept` (concept, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `worked` (worked, 0 checks, adapters python,cpp,java); `faded` (faded, 1 checks, adapters neutral); `visualizer` (visualizer, 1 checks, adapters python,cpp,java); `micro` (micro, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `syntax-repair` (micro, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `pattern` (pattern, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `explanation` (explanation, 1 checks, adapters neutral)

##### Combining conditions — `zero:boolean-logic`

- **Scope:** Use and, or and not to express exact rules, and reason about them precisely.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/boolean-logic.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/zero/boolean-logic.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:conditionals`
- **Key points:** and/&& needs both sides true; or/\|\| needs at least one; not/! flips.; Express ranges as two comparisons joined by and.; Short-circuiting skips the right side when the answer is already known.; De Morgan: not (A and B) = not A or not B, and vice versa.
- **Pitfalls:** Writing `1 <= x <= 10` in C++ or Java.; Negating a compound condition without flipping and/or.; Writing `x == 1 or 2` instead of `x == 1 or x == 2`.
- **Local judge problems:** [Leap year](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/leap-year.yaml>) (`leap-year`, easy); [Who may join the coding club?](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/club-entry.yaml>) (`club-entry`, easy)

##### While loops — `zero:while-loops`

- **Scope:** Repeat a block for as long as a condition stays true — the tool for "keep going until...".
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/while-loops.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/zero/while-loops.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:boolean-logic`
- **Key points:** while repeats its body as long as the condition is true, checking before each round.; Every loop needs a start, a condition, and progress toward stopping.; Missing progress causes an infinite loop.; The accumulator pattern builds an answer one round at a time.
- **Pitfalls:** Forgetting to update the loop variable (infinite loop).; Off-by-one conditions — `>` versus `>=` changes the number of rounds.; Special input like 0 that skips the loop entirely; make sure the answer is still right.
- **Local judge problems:** [Sum of digits](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/digit-sum.yaml>) (`digit-sum`, easy); [Collatz steps](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/collatz-steps.yaml>) (`collatz-steps`, medium); [Reverse the digits](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/reverse-the-digits.yaml>) (`reverse-the-digits`, easy)
- **Quiz items:** `rounds` (output, difficulty 2/5); `infinite` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `zero-input` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `accumulator` (output, difficulty 2/5); `loop-count` (output, difficulty 4/5); `infinite-loop` (bug, difficulty 5/5)
- **Atoms:** `hook` (hook, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `concept` (concept, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `worked` (worked, 0 checks, adapters python,cpp,java); `faded` (faded, 1 checks, adapters neutral); `visualizer` (visualizer, 1 checks, adapters python,cpp,java); `micro` (micro, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `syntax-repair` (micro, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `pattern` (pattern, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `explanation` (explanation, 1 checks, adapters neutral)

##### For loops — `zero:for-loops`

- **Scope:** Repeat a block a known number of times, or once for each item — the everyday loop.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/for-loops.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/zero/for-loops.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:while-loops`
- **Key points:** A for loop bundles start, condition and progress for counting loops.; Python's range(a, b) stops before b; C++/Java conditions decide inclusion explicitly.; Use for when the number of rounds is known, while when it is not.; Trace the first and last round to catch off-by-one errors.
- **Pitfalls:** Writing range(1, n) when you meant 1..n inclusive.; Modifying the loop counter inside the body.; Using int for sums that can exceed about 2.1 billion in C++/Java.
- **Local judge problems:** [FizzBuzz](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/fizzbuzz.yaml>) (`fizzbuzz`, easy); [Sum of multiples](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/sum-of-multiples.yaml>) (`sum-of-multiples`, medium); [A times table](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/times-table.yaml>) (`times-table`, easy)

##### Nested loops — `zero:nested-loops`

- **Scope:** Put a loop inside a loop to handle rows and columns, pairs, and patterns.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/nested-loops.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/zero/nested-loops.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:for-loops`
- **Key points:** For every outer round, the inner loop runs completely.; Total work is the product of the loop sizes.; Inner bounds may depend on the outer counter (triangles, pairs with i < j).; break exits only the innermost loop.
- **Pitfalls:** Putting the newline inside the inner loop instead of after it.; Reusing the same counter name for both loops.; Not noticing that nested loops over large inputs are slow.

#### Working with data — `collections`

Store many values and look them up quickly.

##### Lists and arrays — `zero:lists`

- **Scope:** Store many values in order under one name, and process them with loops.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/lists.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/zero/lists.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:for-loops`
- **Key points:** Lists keep values in order; indexes run from 0 to n − 1.; Loop over values for items, over indexes when position matters.; Out-of-range indexes are errors (and silent bugs in C++).; Most list problems are accumulators, best-so-far, or neighbour comparisons.
- **Pitfalls:** Using 1-based indexes and skipping the first element or overrunning the last.; Comparing a[i] with a[i - 1] starting from i = 0.; Changing a list's length while looping over it.
- **Local judge problems:** [Above the average](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/above-average.yaml>) (`above-average`, easy); [Longest rising streak](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/increasing-steps.yaml>) (`increasing-steps`, medium); [Runner-up score](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/runner-up-score.yaml>) (`runner-up-score`, easy)

##### Strings — `zero:strings`

- **Scope:** Text is a sequence of characters — index it, loop over it, compare it and build new text.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/strings.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/zero/strings.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:lists`
- **Key points:** Strings behave like lists of characters with indexes from 0.; Python and Java strings are immutable; build text with join or StringBuilder.; Characters have numeric codes; 'c' - 'a' gives a letter's position.; In Java compare strings with equals, not ==.
- **Pitfalls:** Using == for strings in Java.; Building long strings with repeated + in a loop (slow in Python/Java).; Forgetting that input lines may carry trailing spaces or newlines.
- **Local judge problems:** [Count the vowels](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/vowel-count.yaml>) (`vowel-count`, easy); [Caesar cipher](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/caesar-shift.yaml>) (`caesar-shift`, medium); [Mirror phrase](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/mirror-phrase.yaml>) (`mirror-phrase`, easy)

##### Dictionaries and maps — `zero:maps`

- **Scope:** Store key → value pairs and look values up instantly by key instead of searching.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/maps.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:strings`
- **Key points:** Maps store key → value pairs; keys are unique.; Lookup, insert and update by key are fast on average, regardless of size.; Counting occurrences is the classic map pattern.; Hash maps are unordered; use a sorted map or sort keys when order matters.; A set stores unique keys for fast "seen before?" checks.
- **Pitfalls:** Reading a missing key (Python KeyError; C++ [] silently inserts 0).; Printing results in hash order when sorted order was required.; Using a list and searching it repeatedly when a map would be instant.
- **Local judge problems:** [Word frequency](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/word-frequency.yaml>) (`word-frequency`, easy); [First repeated number](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/first-repeat.yaml>) (`first-repeat`, medium); [Class election](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/class-election.yaml>) (`class-election`, easy)

##### Grids and 2D lists — `zero:grids`

- **Scope:** Represent boards, maps and tables as lists of rows, and move around them safely.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/grids.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:nested-loops`, `zero:lists`
- **Key points:** A grid is a list of rows; access cells as grid[row][col].; In Python, build rows in a loop — never multiply a list of lists.; Direction arrays make neighbour loops short and uniform.; Check bounds before touching any neighbour.
- **Pitfalls:** Swapping row and column (grid[c][r]).; Reading neighbours outside the grid on edge cells.; Python's shared-row bug from [[0] * cols] * rows.
- **Local judge problems:** [Minesweeper numbers](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/minesweeper-counts.yaml>) (`minesweeper-counts`, medium); [Row and column totals](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/row-and-column-sums.yaml>) (`row-and-column-sums`, easy)

#### Functions and structure — `functions-module`

Break programs into reusable, testable pieces.

##### Functions — `zero:functions`

- **Scope:** Package a piece of logic under a name, give it inputs, and get a result back.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/functions.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:lists`
- **Key points:** Functions take parameters, run their body, and return a value.; return ends the function immediately and hands back a value.; print shows output; return gives a value to the caller — prefer return.; Small, single-purpose, well-named functions make programs readable and testable.
- **Pitfalls:** Printing inside a function when the caller needed the value.; Forgetting to return on every path (C++ may return garbage; Java will not compile).; Calling a function without using its returned value.
- **Local judge problems:** [Prime or not](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/prime-check.yaml>) (`prime-check`, easy); [Greatest common divisor](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/gcd-function.yaml>) (`gcd-function`, medium)
- **Quiz items:** `return-ends` (output, difficulty 1/5); `print-vs-return` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `sqrt-bound` (mcq, difficulty 3/5); `call-value` (output, difficulty 2/5)

##### Scope, references and mutation — `zero:scope-and-mutation`

- **Scope:** Know where a variable lives, and when passing a list to a function lets it change the original.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/scope-and-mutation.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:functions`
- **Key points:** Local variables exist only inside their function or block.; Pass data in as parameters and send results out with return.; In Python and Java, functions receive references to lists/arrays and can mutate them.; C++ copies by default; & passes the original, const & avoids copies safely.; b = a aliases a list in Python/Java; copy explicitly when you need independence.
- **Pitfalls:** Expecting a function to change a number variable of the caller.; Accidentally mutating a list passed in, surprising the caller.; Copying large vectors on every call in C++.
- **Local judge problems:** none
- **Quiz items:** `number-param` (output, difficulty 2/5); `list-param` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `cpp-ref` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `alias` (output, difficulty 3/5)

##### Recursion — `zero:recursion`

- **Scope:** Solve a problem by having a function call itself on a smaller version, until a simple base case.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/recursion.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:functions`
- **Key points:** Every recursive function needs a base case and a step toward it.; Each call gets its own frame on the call stack; frames finish in reverse order.; Trust the recursive call on smaller input (the leap of faith).; Branching recursion can repeat work; memoization remembers answers.
- **Pitfalls:** Missing or unreachable base case — infinite recursion and stack overflow.; Recursing on input that does not get smaller.; Exponential time from naive branching recursion without memoization.
- **Local judge problems:** [Fast power](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/power-recursive.yaml>) (`power-recursive`, medium); [Ways to climb](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/stairs-ways.yaml>) (`stairs-ways`, medium)
- **Quiz items:** `base-case` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `trace` (output, difficulty 2/5); `order` (output, difficulty 3/5); `memo` (mcq, difficulty 3/5)

#### The programmer's craft — `craft`

Debug calmly, solve unfamiliar problems, and model the world with objects.

##### Debugging calmly — `zero:debugging`

- **Scope:** Read error messages, reproduce the bug, find the first wrong value, and fix the cause — not the symptom.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/debugging.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:functions`
- **Key points:** Compile, runtime and logic errors need different responses.; Read the first error message carefully — it gives the line and the kind of problem.; Reproduce with the smallest failing input, predict, observe, and find the first wrong value.; Test edge cases before submitting; remove debug output.
- **Pitfalls:** Changing code randomly until the output looks right.; Fixing the line where the crash appears instead of the reason the value was wrong.; Leaving debug prints in a submission.
- **Local judge problems:** [Fix the average](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/fix-the-average.yaml>) (`fix-the-average`, easy)
- **Quiz items:** `first-error` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `smallest-case` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `logic-bug` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `edge-cases` (mcq, difficulty 2/5)

##### Solving unfamiliar problems — `zero:problem-solving`

- **Scope:** A repeatable process for turning a problem statement you have never seen into working code.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/problem-solving.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:debugging`, `zero:maps`
- **Key points:** Understand the input, output, examples and constraints before coding.; Solve small examples by hand and turn your own steps into an algorithm.; Write pseudocode, then code, then test edge cases.; A correct simple solution first; optimize after.; Reflect on the key insight so each problem teaches a reusable pattern.
- **Pitfalls:** Coding before understanding the examples.; Never testing beyond the given examples.; Watching the solution immediately instead of struggling productively for a while.
- **Local judge problems:** [Does a pair exist?](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/problems/two-sum-exists.yaml>) (`two-sum-exists`, medium)
- **Quiz items:** `first-step` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `constraints` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `brute-force` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `reflect` (mcq, difficulty 1/5)

- **Scope:** Bundle related data and the operations on it into your own types.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/zero/concepts/classes-and-objects.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:scope-and-mutation`
- **Key points:** A class defines a type with data (attributes) and behaviour (methods).; An object is an instance with its own copy of the attributes.; Constructors initialise objects; self/this refers to the current object.; Encapsulation keeps data and its rules together, preventing invalid states.
- **Pitfalls:** Forgetting self in Python method definitions or attribute access.; Sharing one mutable default (like a list) between all Python objects.; Huge classes that do everything instead of one clear job.

### 4.2 DSA for Interviews — `dsa`

The data structures and algorithm patterns that coding interviews actually test, taught as reusable patterns rather than memorised answers. Each topic ends with unseen problems you solve on your own, so you walk into interviews knowing you can do it.

**Course file:** [content/courses/dsa/course.yaml](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/course.yaml>). **Version:** 1.0.0. **Languages:** python, cpp, java.

#### Foundations — `foundations`

Measure efficiency and master the array and hash map toolkit.

##### Time and space complexity — `dsa:complexity`

- **Scope:** Predict how running time and memory grow with input size using Big-O, before you write a line.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/complexity.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/dsa/complexity.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:nested-loops`, `zero:functions`
- **Key points:** Big-O describes growth with input size, ignoring constants and lower terms.; Sequential code adds, nested loops multiply, halving gives log n.; About 10^8 simple operations per second — check your plan against the constraints.; Trading memory for time (hash sets/maps) is the most common optimisation.; Know the hidden cost of library operations (list membership, slicing, string concat).
- **Pitfalls:** Calling an O(n) operation (like list membership) inside a loop, making O(n²).; Ignoring recursion depth as a space cost.; Optimising constant factors before fixing the complexity class.
- **Local judge problems:** [Triangle number queries](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/sum-queries.yaml>) (`sum-queries`, easy); [Matching sock pairs](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/matching-pairs.yaml>) (`matching-pairs`, easy)

- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/arrays-hashing.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/dsa/arrays-hashing.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:complexity`, `zero:maps`
- **Key points:** Hash maps/sets give O(1) average lookup, turning repeated searches into one pass.; Complement lookup — store what you've seen, look for target − x.; Frequency counting solves anagram, majority and top-k style questions.; Canonical keys group equivalent items.; For small known ranges, a counting array beats a hash map.
- **Pitfalls:** Inserting before checking, and pairing an element with itself.; Forgetting that hash maps are unordered when output order matters.; Using mutable lists as Python dict keys (use tuples or strings).

##### Prefix sums — `dsa:prefix-sums`

- **Scope:** Precompute running totals once so any range sum costs O(1), and count subarrays with hash maps.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/prefix-sums.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/dsa/prefix-sums.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:arrays-hashing`
- **Key points:** p[i] holds the sum of the first i elements; sum(l..r) = p[r+1] − p[l].; One O(n) precomputation makes every range query O(1).; Subarrays summing to k ⇔ earlier prefix equal to current − k; count with a hash map.; Prefix ideas extend to 2D, XOR, counts and difference arrays.
- **Pitfalls:** Off-by-one between p indexes and array indexes.; Forgetting to seed the map with prefix 0 (count 1).; 32-bit overflow on large sums.

#### Linear patterns — `linear-patterns`

Two pointers, sliding windows, stacks and binary search.

##### Two pointers — `dsa:two-pointers`

- **Scope:** Move two indexes through sorted or structured data to replace an O(n²) pair search with one O(n) sweep.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/two-pointers.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/dsa/two-pointers.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:arrays-hashing`
- **Key points:** Two indexes, each moving at most n times, give an O(n) sweep.; Opposite ends on sorted data — move the pointer that cannot be part of an answer.; Read/write pointers filter or partition in place with O(1) space.; Sort, fix one element, two-pointer the rest for triples (3Sum).; Always be able to justify why a discarded element can never be in the answer.
- **Pitfalls:** Using opposite-end pointers on unsorted data.; Infinite loops when neither pointer moves in some branch.; Producing duplicate triples by not skipping equal values.
- **Local judge problems:** [Pair sum in a sorted array](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/pair-sum-sorted.yaml>) (`pair-sum-sorted`, easy); [Container with most water](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/container-water.yaml>) (`container-water`, medium); [Pairs with a fixed gap](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/difference-pairs.yaml>) (`difference-pairs`, medium); [Squares in order](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/sorted-squares.yaml>) (`sorted-squares`, easy)

##### Sliding window — `dsa:sliding-window`

- **Scope:** Maintain a contiguous window and its summary as it slides, instead of recomputing every subarray.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/sliding-window.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/dsa/sliding-window.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:two-pointers`
- **Key points:** A window [left, right] plus a running summary avoids recomputing every subarray.; Fixed-size windows add the entering element and remove the leaving one.; Variable windows expand right, shrink left while invalid, then record.; Requires monotonic validity; with negative sums use prefix sums instead.; Exactly-k counts can be atMost(k) − atMost(k − 1).
- **Pitfalls:** Applying a window to sums with negative numbers.; Recording the answer before restoring validity.; Moving left past a stale "last seen" position (check last[ch] ≥ left).
- **Local judge problems:** [Longest substring without repeats](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/longest-unique-substring.yaml>) (`longest-unique-substring`, medium); [Best k-day streak](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/max-window-sum.yaml>) (`max-window-sum`, easy); [Shortest stretch to reach a goal](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/shortest-fundraiser.yaml>) (`shortest-fundraiser`, medium)

##### Stacks, queues and monotonic stacks — `dsa:stacks`

- **Scope:** Last-in-first-out and first-in-first-out containers, and the monotonic stack trick for "next greater" questions.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/stacks.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/dsa/stacks.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:arrays-hashing`
- **Key points:** Stack = LIFO, queue = FIFO; both O(1) per operation with the right container.; A stack holds the most recent unfinished item — perfect for matching brackets.; Monotonic stacks answer next/previous greater/smaller in O(n) total.; Amortised analysis — each element is pushed and popped at most once.; Use deque for queues in Python, never list.pop(0).
- **Pitfalls:** Popping from an empty stack (check first).; Forgetting to check that the stack is empty at the end (unmatched openers).; Storing values instead of indexes when you need positions or distances.

##### Monotonic stack and deque — `dsa:monotonic-stack`

- **Scope:** Next greater and smaller elements, spans, histogram areas, contribution counting and the sliding-window maximum deque.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/monotonic-stack.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:stacks`, `dsa:sliding-window`
- **Key points:** A monotonic stack keeps the indexes still waiting for an answer, in sorted value order.; An element is answered at the moment it is popped; each index is pushed and popped once, so O(n).; Scan direction and pop comparison pick next/previous and greater/smaller.; Store indexes when the answer is a distance or position.; Histogram: pop on a lower bar; area = height × (i − left − 1); end with a 0 bar.; Contribution: Σ a[i] · left[i] · right[i], strict on one side and non-strict on the other.; Monotonic deque: pop worse values from the back, expired ones from the front.
- **Pitfalls:** Taking the maximum to the right instead of the nearest greater.; Popping on <= versus < without thinking about equal values.; Pushing values when distances or expiry need indexes.; Forgetting the 0 sentinel bar in the histogram.; Using the same tie rule on both sides when counting subarrays.

##### Binary search — `dsa:binary-search`

- **Scope:** Halve the search space each step — on sorted arrays and on the answer itself.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/binary-search.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/dsa/binary-search.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:complexity`, `dsa:arrays-hashing`
- **Key points:** Binary search halves the range each step — O(log n).; Use one template - the first index where a monotonic condition becomes true.; Lower/upper bounds give existence, counts and insertion positions.; Binary search on the answer when feasibility is monotonic.; mid = lo + (hi − lo) / 2 avoids overflow.
- **Pitfalls:** Infinite loops from lo = mid instead of mid + 1.; Using it on unsorted data, or on a non-monotonic condition.; Forgetting the "not found" case (index n).

#### Sorting and greedy — `ordering`

Sort to reveal structure, then make provably safe greedy choices.

##### Sorting — `dsa:sorting`

- **Scope:** How merge sort and quicksort reach O(n log n), how to sort by custom rules, and why sorting first simplifies problems.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/sorting.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/dsa/sorting.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:complexity`, `zero:recursion`
- **Key points:** Comparison sorting is O(n log n) at best; library sorts already achieve it.; Merge sort - split, recurse, merge — stable, O(n log n), O(n) space; counts inversions.; Quicksort is fast on average; quickselect finds the k-th element in O(n) average.; Sort by tuples / comparators for multi-key ordering.; Sorting first often turns hard problems into easy scans.
- **Pitfalls:** Non-strict comparators in C++ (using <=).; Forgetting tie-breaking rules required by the problem.; Sorting inside a loop, accidentally making O(n² log n).
- **Local judge problems:** [Leaderboard](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/rank-students.yaml>) (`rank-students`, easy); [Count inversions](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/count-inversions.yaml>) (`count-inversions`, hard)

##### Intervals — `dsa:intervals`

- **Scope:** Sort intervals by start, then sweep once to merge, insert, or detect overlaps.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/intervals.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/dsa/intervals.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:sorting`
- **Key points:** Sort by start; then overlaps involve only neighbours in the sweep.; Overlap of [a, b] and [c, d] ⇔ a ≤ d and c ≤ b — clarify whether touching counts.; Merge by extending the last block with max(end).; Sweep line - +1/−1 events sorted by time give concurrent counts.; Sorting by end time enables greedy selection.
- **Pitfalls:** Forgetting max() when merging nested intervals.; Mis-ordering events at equal times (end before start or vice versa).; Not clarifying whether touching intervals overlap.
- **Local judge problems:** [Merge study sessions](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/merge-intervals.yaml>) (`merge-intervals`, medium)
- **Quiz items:** `overlap` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `nested` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `rooms` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `first-step` (mcq, difficulty 1/5)

##### Greedy algorithms — `dsa:greedy`

- **Scope:** Make the locally best choice at each step — and learn to prove when that is globally optimal.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/greedy.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/dsa/greedy.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:sorting`, `dsa:intervals`
- **Key points:** Greedy takes the locally best choice and never reconsiders.; Usually - sort by the right key, then one pass.; Justify with an exchange argument — swapping into the greedy choice never hurts.; Test greedy ideas against brute force on small cases; if it fails, think DP.
- **Pitfalls:** Picking an intuitive but wrong ordering (shortest, earliest start).; Assuming greedy works for general coin systems.; Skipping the proof and missing a counterexample.
- **Local judge problems:** [Most mentoring sessions](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/max-meetings.yaml>) (`max-meetings`, medium); [Jump to the end](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/can-reach-end.yaml>) (`can-reach-end`, medium)
- **Quiz items:** `activity-key` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `coins-fail` (mcq, difficulty 3/5); `exchange` (mcq, difficulty 3/5); `jump` (mcq, difficulty 2/5)

#### Linked structures, recursion and backtracking — `recursive-structures`

Pointers and nodes, recursion patterns, and exhaustive search done cleanly.

##### Linked lists — `dsa:linked-lists`

- **Scope:** Nodes connected by pointers — O(1) insertion and removal anywhere, and the pointer-juggling interviewers love.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/linked-lists.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:complexity`, `zero:classes-and-objects`
- **Key points:** Nodes hold a value and a pointer to the next node; no random access.; Insert/delete next to a known node in O(1); finding a node is O(n).; Rewire pointers in the right order; a dummy head removes edge cases.; Reverse in place with prev/curr/next in one pass.; Fast/slow pointers find the middle and detect cycles in O(1) space.
- **Pitfalls:** Losing the rest of the list by overwriting next too early.; Null pointer access at the end of the list.; Forgetting to update head when the first node changes.
- **Local judge problems:** [Playlist editor](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/playlist-editor.yaml>) (`playlist-editor`, medium)
- **Quiz items:** `insert-order` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `access-cost` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `cycle` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `dummy` (mcq, difficulty 2/5)

##### Backtracking — `dsa:backtracking`

- **Scope:** Explore every choice recursively — choose, explore, un-choose — and prune branches that cannot succeed.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/backtracking.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:recursion`, `dsa:complexity`
- **Key points:** Backtracking explores a decision tree - choose, explore, un-choose.; Record copies of the current state, never the shared object.; Prune branches that can no longer succeed — this is what makes it fast enough.; Expect exponential growth; check n is small (≤ ~20 subsets, ≤ ~10 permutations).
- **Pitfalls:** Saving a reference to the mutable current list instead of a copy.; Missing the un-choose step.; Generating duplicate results from duplicate input values.
- **Local judge problems:** [Subsets with target sum](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/subset-sum-count.yaml>) (`subset-sum-count`, medium); [N-Queens](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/n-queens-count.yaml>) (`n-queens-count`, hard)

#### Trees and heaps — `trees`

Recursive data, ordered trees, priority queues and prefix trees.

##### Binary trees — `dsa:binary-trees`

- **Scope:** Recursive data where each node has up to two children — traverse depth-first and breadth-first, and solve with recursion.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/binary-trees.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:linked-lists`, `zero:recursion`
- **Key points:** A tree is a root plus left and right subtrees — solve recursively.; Pre-, in- and post-order are depth-first; level order uses a queue.; Return values up (height, size) or pass state down (depth, range).; Deep trees can overflow recursion; iterate with an explicit stack or reverse BFS order.
- **Pitfalls:** Forgetting the empty-tree (null) base case.; Confusing height in nodes vs. height in edges — confirm the definition.; Stack overflow on degenerate (chain-shaped) trees.
- **Local judge problems:** [Level sums](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/tree-levels.yaml>) (`tree-levels`, easy); [Binary tree diameter](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/tree-diameter.yaml>) (`tree-diameter`, medium)
- **Quiz items:** `inorder` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `bfs-structure` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `height-trace` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `postorder-use` (mcq, difficulty 2/5)

##### Binary tree patterns — `dsa:tree-patterns`

- **Scope:** Return information from children, views and columns, root paths, lowest common ancestor, distance K and width.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/tree-patterns.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:binary-trees`
- **Key points:** Return info: a node returns what its parent can extend and records the full answer in a global.; For path sums, return one branch (val + max(gl, gr)) but record both (val + gl + gr).; Process children before parents with reverse BFS order to avoid deep recursion.; Views and levels: BFS level by level; take the first or last node of each level.; Root paths: pass the running sum, maximum or number down; check at leaves.; LCA: equalise depths, then lift both until they meet.; Distance K and width: add parent edges for BFS; number positions 2p and 2p + 1, renumbered per level.
- **Pitfalls:** Returning a two-sided path to the parent.; Not dropping negative branches, or starting the best at 0.; Following only right children for the right view.; Treating a node with one child as a leaf.; Lifting both nodes before their depths are equal.; Searching only downwards for distance K.
- **Local judge problems:** [Balanced splits](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/balanced-splits.yaml>) (`balanced-splits`, medium); [Shortest walk to a leaf](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/nearest-leaf.yaml>) (`nearest-leaf`, medium)

##### Binary search trees — `dsa:bst`

- **Scope:** Keep keys ordered in a tree so search, insert and delete follow one root-to-leaf path.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/bst.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:binary-trees`, `dsa:binary-search`, `dsa:tree-patterns`
- **Key points:** BST rule - left subtree keys < node < right subtree keys.; Search, insert and delete walk one path, costing O(height).; Inorder traversal of a BST yields sorted keys.; Validate with a (low, high) range passed down, not just parent-child checks.; Unbalanced BSTs degrade to O(n); library ordered sets/maps stay O(log n).
- **Pitfalls:** Validating only against the immediate parent.; Assuming O(log n) without balance (sorted insertions make a chain).; Mishandling duplicate keys — define where equal keys go.
- **Local judge problems:** [Validate a BST](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/bst-validate.yaml>) (`bst-validate`, medium)
- **Quiz items:** `inorder-sorted` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `validate-trap` (mcq, difficulty 3/5); `sorted-insert` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `lca` (mcq, difficulty 2/5)

##### Heaps and priority queues — `dsa:heaps`

- **Scope:** Always get the smallest (or largest) item in O(log n) — the engine behind top-k, scheduling and Dijkstra.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/heaps.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:binary-trees`
- **Key points:** Heaps give O(1) peek and O(log n) push/pop of the min (or max).; Python and Java default to min-heaps; C++ priority_queue defaults to max.; Array layout - children at 2i+1, 2i+2; sift up on push, sift down on pop.; Top-k - keep a min-heap of size k for the k largest.; Two heaps maintain a running median.
- **Pitfalls:** Forgetting C++'s default max-heap behaviour.; Sorting everything when a size-k heap suffices.; Searching a heap for arbitrary elements (O(n)) — heaps only make the top fast.
- **Local judge problems:** [Live k-th best score](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/kth-largest-stream.yaml>) (`kth-largest-stream`, medium)

##### Tries (prefix trees) — `dsa:tries`

- **Scope:** Store strings character by character in a tree so prefix questions cost O(length), not O(number of words).
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/tries.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:binary-trees`, `zero:strings`
- **Key points:** Each trie edge is a character; a root-to-node path spells a prefix.; Insert and prefix queries take O(length), independent of the number of words.; Node counts answer how many words share a prefix; end markers mark whole words.; Use a hash set instead when you only need exact lookups.
- **Pitfalls:** Confusing "prefix exists" with "word exists" (missing end markers).; Excess memory from allocating 26 children for every node with huge inputs.; Recursion depth when deleting or traversing very long words.
- **Local judge problems:** [Autocomplete counts](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/prefix-counts.yaml>) (`prefix-counts`, medium)
- **Quiz items:** `prefix-cost` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `end-marker` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `counts` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `when-not` (mcq, difficulty 2/5)

#### Graphs — `graphs`

Traverse, order, connect and find shortest paths.

##### Graphs, BFS and DFS — `dsa:graph-traversal`

- **Scope:** Model relationships as nodes and edges, then explore them depth-first or breadth-first.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/graph-traversal.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:stacks`, `zero:grids`
- **Key points:** Store graphs as adjacency lists — O(V + E) memory.; BFS (queue) gives shortest paths in unweighted graphs.; DFS (recursion/stack) explores deeply — components, cycles, flood fill.; Mark nodes visited when they are first discovered.; Both run in O(V + E); grids are implicit graphs.
- **Pitfalls:** Forgetting the reverse edge in undirected graphs.; Marking visited on dequeue, causing duplicate work.; Recursion depth limits for DFS on large graphs.
- **Local judge problems:** [Count the islands](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/count-islands.yaml>) (`count-islands`, medium); [Fewest hops](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/fewest-hops.yaml>) (`fewest-hops`, medium)
- **Quiz items:** `bfs-shortest` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `complexity` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `components` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `mark-time` (mcq, difficulty 2/5)

##### Topological sort — `dsa:topological-sort`

- **Scope:** Order tasks so every prerequisite comes first — and detect impossible cycles.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/topological-sort.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:graph-traversal`
- **Key points:** A topological order puts every prerequisite before what depends on it.; It exists iff the directed graph has no cycle.; Kahn's algorithm repeatedly removes in-degree-0 nodes; leftovers indicate a cycle.; A min-heap instead of a queue yields the lexicographically smallest order.; Topological order enables DP on DAGs.
- **Pitfalls:** Reversing edge direction (a → b must mean a before b).; Forgetting to report cycles when the order is incomplete.; Using a plain queue when the smallest valid order is required.
- **Local judge problems:** [Course order](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/course-order.yaml>) (`course-order`, medium)

##### Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) — `dsa:union-find`

- **Scope:** Merge groups and ask "same group?" in near-constant time — connectivity, cycles and Kruskal's MST.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/union-find.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:graph-traversal`
- **Key points:** DSU keeps groups as trees; the root identifies the group.; Path compression + union by size give near-constant amortised operations.; union returns whether a merge happened — that detects cycles.; Track component count by decrementing on successful unions.; Kruskal's MST = sorted edges + DSU.
- **Pitfalls:** Comparing elements instead of their roots.; Skipping both optimisations, leading to O(n) chains.; Expecting DSU to support splitting groups.
- **Local judge problems:** [Growing friend groups](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/online-components.yaml>) (`online-components`, medium)

##### Weighted shortest paths — `dsa:shortest-paths`

- **Scope:** Dijkstra's algorithm — always settle the closest unsettled node — for graphs with non-negative weights.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/shortest-paths.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:graph-traversal`, `dsa:heaps`
- **Key points:** Dijkstra = BFS with a min-heap on distance; works only with non-negative weights.; The first time a node is popped, its distance is final.; Skip stale heap entries with if d > dist[u]; continue.; O((V + E) log V); use 64-bit distances.; Negative edges → Bellman-Ford; all pairs → Floyd-Warshall; 0/1 weights → 0-1 BFS.
- **Pitfalls:** Running Dijkstra with negative weights.; Not skipping stale entries (still correct, but slow on dense updates).; Overflow from 32-bit distances or from INF + w.
- **Local judge problems:** [Cheapest routes](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/cheapest-routes.yaml>) (`cheapest-routes`, medium)

#### Dynamic programming and bits — `dynamic-programming`

Turn exponential search into polynomial tables; use bits as tools.

##### Dynamic programming: the idea — `dsa:dp-introduction`

- **Scope:** Overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, Fibonacci four ways, spotting DP, and printing the choices behind an answer.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/dp-introduction.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:recursion`, `dsa:complexity`
- **Key points:** DP stores answers to repeated subproblems so each is solved once.; Write the state as a sentence, then the transition, base cases, answer cell and loop order.; Derive with recursion, fix with memoization, scale with tabulation, compress space last.; Plain Fibonacci recursion makes 2·F(n+1) − 1 calls; memoization makes about 2n.; If a greedy rule has a small counterexample and situations repeat, use DP.; To print the choices, record which option won at every cell and walk back from the answer.
- **Pitfalls:** Recursing without a memo on inputs of 40 or more.; Computing a value in the memoized function but never storing it.; Base cases that make every answer zero, such as ways(0) = 0.; Compressing the table before checking whether the output needs the path.
- **Local judge problems:** [Colouring the posts](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/fence-painting.yaml>) (`fence-painting`, medium); [Stepping stones](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/stepping-stones-path.yaml>) (`stepping-stones-path`, medium)

##### Dynamic programming (1D) — `dsa:dp-1d`

- **Scope:** Define a state, write the recurrence, fill a table — and turn exponential recursion into linear time.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/dp-1d.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:recursion`, `dsa:complexity`, `dsa:dp-introduction`
- **Key points:** DP = state + transition + base cases + answer.; Each state is computed once, so exponential recursion becomes polynomial.; Top-down (memo) to derive; bottom-up (table) to scale.; Often only the last few states are needed — reduce memory to O(1).; Counting DPs take results modulo 1e9+7.
- **Pitfalls:** A vague state definition — write it as a full sentence.; Wrong iteration order so a state is used before it's computed.; Forgetting unreachable states (∞ or −1) and printing them as answers.
- **Local judge problems:** [Non-adjacent picks](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/house-robber.yaml>) (`house-robber`, medium); [Fewest coins](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/min-coins.yaml>) (`min-coins`, medium)

##### Dynamic programming (2D) — `dsa:dp-2d`

- **Scope:** States with two indexes — grids, two strings, items × capacity — filled row by row.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/dp-2d.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:dp-1d`
- **Key points:** 2D states describe grid positions, prefix pairs of two strings, or items × capacity.; LCS - match → diagonal + 1, otherwise max of top and left.; Fill in dependency order; often only the previous row is needed.; 0/1 knapsack in 1D iterates capacity downwards.; Reconstruct solutions by walking back through the table.
- **Pitfalls:** Index offsets between dp (1-based prefixes) and strings (0-based).; Iterating knapsack capacity upwards (accidentally unbounded).; O(n·m) memory when only one previous row is needed.

##### 0/1 knapsack family — `dsa:knapsack-01`

- **Scope:** Take or skip each item once: knapsack, subset sum, equal partition, counting subsets, minimum difference and two capacities.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/knapsack-01.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:dp-2d`
- **Key points:** 0/1 knapsack: each item is taken once or skipped; dp over (items, budget).; dp[i][c] = max(dp[i−1][c], dp[i−1][c−w] + v); base row all zeros.; One row is enough if capacity is filled from W down, so no item is reused.; Subset sum uses or; counting uses +; the best total uses max. Same table.; Count partitions with difference D by counting subsets with sum (total + D) / 2.; Two budgets give a 2D state; loop both budgets backwards.; Greedy by value per weight is only correct for the fractional knapsack.
- **Pitfalls:** Looping capacity forwards in the one-row version, which reuses items.; Greedy by value per weight on whole items.; can[0] or ways[0] left at false or 0, which makes nothing reachable.; An inner loop that stops before s == x, which silently ignores zeros when counting.; Missing the parity check when the target is (total + D) / 2.
- **Local judge problems:** [Exact change at the festival](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/exact-change-festival.yaml>) (`exact-change-festival`, medium); [Fair teams](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/fair-teams.yaml>) (`fair-teams`, medium)

##### Unbounded knapsack family — `dsa:knapsack-unbounded`

- **Scope:** Items you can reuse: unbounded knapsack, rod cutting, fewest coins, and why loop order separates combinations from permutations.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/knapsack-unbounded.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:knapsack-01`
- **Key points:** Unbounded knapsack: each item can be taken any number of times.; One row filled forwards (c from w up to W) reuses items on purpose.; In the 2D table, a take reads the same row dp[i][c − w], not the row above.; Fewest coins: dp[0] = 0, every other cell infinity; −1 if still infinity.; "Exactly W" needs unreachable markers; "at most W" can start from zeros.; Counting ways - coins outer counts combinations, amount outer counts permutations.; Greedy largest-first or best-ratio-first fails for many inputs.
- **Pitfalls:** Looping capacity backwards, which turns it into 0/1 knapsack.; Starting a minimum DP at 0 instead of infinity.; Swapping the two loops when counting ways.; Overflow from INF + 1 in C++ or Java.; Trusting greedy coin change because the examples pass.
- **Local judge problems:** [Ride tokens](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/ride-tokens.yaml>) (`ride-tokens`, medium); [Bundles of stickers](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/bundle-count.yaml>) (`bundle-count`, medium)

##### Strings DP: the LCS family — `dsa:dp-lcs`

- **Scope:** Longest common subsequence and its relatives: common substring, supersequence, palindromic subsequence and subsequence matching.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/dp-lcs.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:dp-2d`, `zero:strings`
- **Key points:** dp[i][j] compares the prefixes a[:i] and b[:j]; row 0 and column 0 are 0.; LCS: match → up-left + 1; mismatch → max(up, left).; Greedy matching is wrong for LCS but right for checking that s is a subsequence of t.; Common substring: mismatch resets to 0, and the answer is the largest cell.; Shortest common supersequence: n + m − LCS; print it by walking back.; Longest palindromic subsequence fills i from n − 1 down, because row i reads row i + 1.; Two rows give the length in O(m) memory; printing the answer needs the full table.
- **Pitfalls:** Taking up-left on a mismatch, which drops a character that might still match.; Confusing a[i] with a[i − 1] when the table is indexed by prefix length.; Printing dp[n][m] for longest common substring instead of the maximum cell.; Filling the palindrome table with i ascending.; Greedy pointer matching for LCS.
- **Local judge problems:** [Shared playlist](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/weighted-common-playlist.yaml>) (`weighted-common-playlist`, medium); [Palindrome trimming](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/palindrome-trim.yaml>) (`palindrome-trim`, medium)

##### Strings DP: edits and matching — `dsa:dp-edit-distance`

- **Scope:** Edit distance, distinct subsequences, wildcard and regex matching, interleaving strings and palindromic substrings.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/dp-edit-distance.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:dp-lcs`
- **Key points:** dp[i][j] turns a[:i] into b[:j]; the base row is j inserts, the base column i deletes.; Equal last characters cost nothing; otherwise 1 + min(delete, insert, replace).; n + m − 2·LCS is correct only when replace is not allowed.; Distinct subsequences: count with ways[0] = 1 and j backwards, like 0/1 knapsack.; Wildcard * is empty or eats one more character; regex x* skips the pair (j − 2).; Interleaving: the last character of s3[:i+j] came from s1 or from s2; check lengths first.; Palindromic substrings expand from 2n − 1 centres, odd and even.
- **Pitfalls:** Base row and column left at 0.; Adding 1 when the last characters are equal.; Dropping the replace option, or using the LCS shortcut when replace is allowed.; Looping j forwards when counting distinct subsequences.; Greedy pointers for interleaving or for wildcard stars.
- **Local judge problems:** [Priced typo fixes](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/typo-costs.yaml>) (`typo-costs`, medium); [Wildcard sightings](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/wildcard-sightings.yaml>) (`wildcard-sightings`, medium)

##### Stock trading DP — `dsa:dp-stocks`

- **Scope:** One state machine, day by holding by transactions left, that solves all six buy-and-sell-stock problems.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/dp-stocks.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:dp-2d`
- **Key points:** States: holding a share or not, plus transactions left; moves: rest, buy, sell.; cash[t] = max(cash[t], hold[t] + p); hold[t] = max(hold[t], cash[t − 1] − p).; hold starts at −∞, cash at 0; the answer is cash[k].; Loop t from k down so a buy reads yesterday's cash[t − 1].; Unlimited trades - sum of every daily rise; greedy is correct only then.; Fee: subtract once when selling. Cooldown: buy from cash two days ago.; O(n·k) time, O(k) memory.
- **Pitfalls:** hold initialised to 0, which allows selling a share never bought.; Buying from cash[t] instead of cash[t − 1], which ignores the transaction limit.; Keeping the k largest rising runs instead of running the machine.; Charging the fee on both sides of a trade.; Cooldown buy reading yesterday's cash.
- **Local judge problems:** [Warehouse trading](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/warehouse-trading.yaml>) (`warehouse-trading`, medium); [Trading with rest days](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/rest-days.yaml>) (`rest-days`, medium)
- **Quiz items:** `states` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `unlimited` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `hold-init` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `buy-index` (mcq, difficulty 3/5); `runs-greedy` (mcq, difficulty 4/5); `fee` (mcq, difficulty 3/5); `cooldown` (mcq, difficulty 4/5); `k-output` (output, difficulty 5/5)

##### Longest increasing subsequence family — `dsa:dp-lis`

- **Scope:** LIS in O(n^2) and O(n log n), printing it, and variants: divisible subsets, chains, bitonic, counts and envelopes.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/dp-lis.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:dp-1d`, `dsa:binary-search`
- **Key points:** dp[i] is the longest increasing subsequence ending at a[i]; the answer is max(dp).; dp[i] = 1 + max dp[j] over earlier, smaller a[j]; O(n²).; Patience sorting: tails[L] is the smallest tail of a chain of length L + 1; O(n log n).; Strict LIS uses lower bound; non-decreasing uses upper bound.; tails gives the length only; print an LIS with parent pointers.; Unordered items - sort by one key (ties descending), then LIS on the other.; Fewest removals to make it increasing = n − LIS.
- **Pitfalls:** Printing dp[n − 1] instead of the maximum over all i.; Using <= or upper bound for a strictly increasing subsequence.; Treating tails as an actual subsequence.; Sorting a sequence whose order matters.; Envelopes sorted with equal widths in ascending height.
- **Local judge problems:** [Tidy shelf](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/tidy-shelf.yaml>) (`tidy-shelf`, medium); [Heaviest rising chain](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/heaviest-rise.yaml>) (`heaviest-rise`, medium)

##### Partition DP (matrix chain) — `dsa:dp-partition`

- **Scope:** Try every split point between i and j: matrix chains, cutting sticks, bursting balloons, boolean ways and minimum cuts.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/dp-partition.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:dp-2d`
- **Key points:** dp[i][j] solves the range i..j by trying every split point k and combining two smaller ranges.; Fill by range length, so every part is ready before the range that reads it.; Matrix chain: dp[i][j] = min dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + p[i]·p[k+1]·p[j+1].; Cut a stick: think about the first cut; burst balloons: think about the last burst.; Boolean ways: keep true and false counts for every range.; Front partition: if only the last piece matters, a prefix state gives O(n²).; Interval DP is O(n³) time and O(n²) memory.
- **Pitfalls:** Filling ranges row by row from the top instead of by length.; The wrong dimension product for the last multiplication.; Unsorted cut positions or missing sentinels.; Choosing the first balloon instead of the last.; Keeping only true counts in boolean ways.
- **Local judge problems:** [Merging crate stacks](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/crate-merging.yaml>) (`crate-merging`, medium); [Signal splits](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/signal-splits.yaml>) (`signal-splits`, medium)

##### DP on squares and rectangles — `dsa:dp-squares`

- **Scope:** Maximal square, counting all-ones squares and the maximal rectangle built from a histogram per row.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/dp-squares.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:dp-2d`, `dsa:monotonic-stack`
- **Key points:** dp[i][j] is the side of the largest all-ones square whose bottom-right corner is (i, j).; On a 1 cell, 1 + min(up, left, up-left); on a 0 cell, 0.; The diagonal is the only neighbour that checks the square's far corner.; One row is enough if the old dp[j] is saved as the next diagonal.; The sum of all dp values counts every all-ones square.; Rectangles: build a histogram per row and run the largest-rectangle stack on each.
- **Pitfalls:** Leaving out the diagonal neighbour.; Printing the side instead of the area.; Not resetting a height or a dp value to 0 on an empty cell.; Trying to store the largest rectangle per cell as one number.
- **Local judge problems:** [Solar panel plots](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/solar-squares.yaml>) (`solar-squares`, medium); [Fence around the meadow](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/meadow-fence.yaml>) (`meadow-fence`, medium)

##### DP on trees — `dsa:dp-on-trees`

- **Scope:** Post-order DP over tree nodes: rob or skip, best path through a node and camera-style cover states.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/dp-on-trees.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:dp-1d`, `dsa:tree-patterns`
- **Key points:** Subproblems are subtrees; fill children before parents (reverse BFS order).; Keep one answer per node state when the parent's choice depends on the child's.; Rob or skip: take = val + Σ skip(children); skip = Σ max(take, skip)(children).; Path through a node: record 1 + two best allowed arms, return 1 + the best arm.; A child that may not join is still solved on its own.; Cover states: camera here, covered by a child, waiting for the parent; the root cannot wait.; O(n) time and memory.
- **Pitfalls:** Alternating levels instead of deciding per node.; Adding take of a child when the parent is taken.; Dropping a blocked child's subtree in path problems.; Only two states for camera problems.; Deep recursion on long chains.
- **Local judge problems:** [Watchtowers on the trails](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/watchtowers.yaml>) (`watchtowers`, medium); [Street lamps on a tree](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/street-lamps.yaml>) (`street-lamps`, hard)

##### Bit manipulation — `dsa:bit-manipulation`

- **Scope:** Treat integers as arrays of bits — XOR tricks, masks, and counting set bits.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/bit-manipulation.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:complexity`
- **Key points:** AND, OR, XOR, NOT and shifts manipulate bits directly.; x & (x − 1) removes the lowest set bit; power of two ⇔ x > 0 and x & (x − 1) == 0.; XOR cancels pairs - a ^ a = 0, so XOR of all values finds the unpaired one.; Masks from 0 to 2^n − 1 enumerate all subsets.; Use 64-bit shifts (1LL, 1L) for large bit positions.
- **Pitfalls:** Operator precedence — wrap bit expressions in parentheses (in C++/Java & binds weaker than ==).; Overflow from 1 << k with 32-bit ints.; Python's ~ producing negative numbers unexpectedly.
- **Local judge problems:** [The unpaired badge](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/single-number.yaml>) (`single-number`, easy)
- **Quiz items:** `xor-pairs` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `power-two` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `subsets` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `and-value` (mcq, difficulty 2/5)

##### More interview DP patterns — `dsa:dp-advanced-patterns`

- **Scope:** Bitmask DP on small sets, minimax games, state-machine counting and a first look at digit DP.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/concepts/dp-advanced-patterns.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:knapsack-01`, `dsa:dp-partition`, `dsa:bit-manipulation`
- **Key points:** The state is exactly what the future depends on - a set, a position, a recent history or a digit prefix.; Bitmask DP: dp[mask] over used items; the next worker is popcount(mask); O(2ⁿ · n).; Increasing mask order is a valid fill order, because adding a bit makes a larger number.; Games: store the best score difference for the player to move; mine = (sum + diff) / 2.; State-machine counting: remember only what the rules look back at; build the next day in a new table.; Digit DP: (position, property so far, tight); a range is count(B) − count(A − 1).
- **Pitfalls:** Greedy choices in assignment or in games.; Using a loop index instead of popcount(mask) for the current worker.; Adding the opponent's best instead of subtracting it.; A counting state that forgets part of a rule.; Forgetting the tight flag in digit DP.
- **Local judge problems:** [Lab partners](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/lab-partners.yaml>) (`lab-partners`, medium); [Take one or two](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/dsa/problems/two-coin-take.yaml>) (`two-coin-take`, medium)

#### Contest fundamentals — `contest-basics`

Fast I/O, overflow, budgeting operations, simulation and complete search.

##### Fast I/O, overflow and operation budgets — `cp:fast-io`

- **Scope:** The contest basics that silently cost points — slow input, 32-bit overflow, and solutions that cannot fit the time limit.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/fast-io.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/cp/fast-io.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `zero:input-and-arithmetic`, `dsa:complexity`
- **Key points:** Read input in bulk and write output once; avoid Scanner (Java) and endl (C++).; Use 64-bit integers for sums and products; cast before multiplying.; Budget ~10^8 simple ops/s in C++, ~10^7 in Python before you code.; With many test cases, reset state per case and rely on the sum-of-n bound.
- **Pitfalls:** TLE from slow I/O on an otherwise correct solution.; Overflow in int × int before assigning to a 64-bit variable.; Re-allocating large arrays for every test case.
- **Local judge problems:** [Many test cases](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/sum-big.yaml>) (`sum-big`, easy); [A million additions](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/pairwise-sums.yaml>) (`pairwise-sums`, easy)
- **Quiz items:** `overflow-product` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `budget` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `java-input` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `endl` (mcq, difficulty 1/5); `sync-off` (mcq, difficulty 4/5); `endl-cost` (mcq, difficulty 5/5)
- **Atoms:** `hook` (hook, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `concept` (concept, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `worked` (worked, 0 checks, adapters python,cpp,java); `faded` (faded, 1 checks, adapters neutral); `visualizer` (visualizer, 1 checks, adapters python,cpp,java); `micro` (micro, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `syntax-repair` (micro, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `pattern` (pattern, 0 checks, adapters neutral); `explanation` (explanation, 1 checks, adapters neutral)

##### Simulation and implementation — `cp:simulation`

- **Scope:** Translate a long statement into exact code — the skill behind most Div 3 A–C problems.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/simulation.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/cp/simulation.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `cp:fast-io`, `zero:grids`
- **Key points:** Model the full state, implement one step, then loop.; Direction arrays turn four branches into one formula.; Check the number of steps against the time limit before simulating.; For huge step counts, find a cycle or closed form.
- **Pitfalls:** Updating state in place when all updates should happen "simultaneously".; Misreading the order of operations in the statement.; Simulating 10^18 steps instead of finding the cycle.
- **Local judge problems:** [Robot on a grid](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/robot-walk.yaml>) (`robot-walk`, medium); [Lift log](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/lift-log.yaml>) (`lift-log`, easy)
- **Quiz items:** `turn-right` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `simultaneous` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `huge-steps` (mcq, difficulty 3/5); `simulate-size` (mcq, difficulty 4/5); `order-of-updates` (mcq, difficulty 5/5)

- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/complete-search.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/cp/complete-search.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `cp:simulation`, `dsa:backtracking`
- **Key points:** Small constraints signal complete search - n ≤ 8 permutations, n ≤ 20 subsets.; Count the work (n! · n, 2^n · n) against the time limit before writing.; Use next_permutation / itertools / bitmasks to enumerate cleanly.; Meet in the middle halves the exponent for n ≈ 40.; Brute force on random small tests is the best way to find bugs in clever solutions.
- **Pitfalls:** Forgetting to start next_permutation from the sorted order.; Underestimating the constant factor of 2^n · n in Python.; Missing symmetric duplicates that double the work.

- **Key points:** gcd by Euclid in O(log); lcm = a / gcd · b.; Trial division up to √n tests primality and factorizes.; Divisor count = product of (exponent + 1).; The sieve finds all primes up to N in O(N log log N); spf sieve answers factorization queries fast.
- **Pitfalls:** Starting the sieve's crossing-out at 2p instead of p² (correct but slower) or overflowing p*p.; Forgetting the leftover prime > √n after trial division.; Computing lcm as a·b/gcd and overflowing.

- **Key points:** Product rule for independent choices; sum rule for disjoint cases.; C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n − k)!); precompute factorials and inverse factorials for O(1) queries.; Grid paths are C(a + b, a); stars and bars gives C(n + k − 1, k − 1).; Complement counting and inclusion–exclusion simplify "at least one" questions.
- **Pitfalls:** Returning garbage for k > n or k < 0 instead of 0.; Computing an inverse for every query instead of precomputing.; Using Fermat inverses with a non-prime modulus.
- **Local judge problems:** [Choosing teams](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/binomial-queries.yaml>) (`binomial-queries`, medium); [Routes across the city grid](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/grid-routes-mod.yaml>) (`grid-routes-mod`, medium)

#### Core techniques — `techniques`

Difference arrays, binary search on the answer, greedy proofs and bitmasks.

##### Prefix sums and difference arrays — `cp:prefix-difference`

- **Scope:** O(1) range queries with prefix sums, O(1) range updates with difference arrays, and their 2D versions.

- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:prefix-sums`, `cp:fast-io`
- **Key points:** Prefix sums - O(1) range-sum queries on a static array.; Difference arrays - O(1) range additions, one final prefix pass.; 2D versions use inclusion–exclusion.; Interleaved updates and queries need Fenwick/segment trees.
- **Pitfalls:** Allocating diff of size n + 1 and writing diff[r + 1] out of bounds.; Forgetting 64-bit accumulators.; Sign errors in 2D inclusion–exclusion.
- **Local judge problems:** [Range additions](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/range-add.yaml>) (`range-add`, easy)

##### Binary search on the answer — `cp:binary-search-answer`

- **Scope:** Turn "find the optimum" into "is this value feasible?" and binary search the boundary.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/binary-search-answer.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/cp/binary-search-answer.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:binary-search`, `cp:fast-io`
- **Key points:** Optimisation → feasibility check + binary search, when feasibility is monotonic.; Each check is usually a greedy O(n) scan; total O(n log range).; First-true uses mid = (lo + hi) / 2; last-true uses (lo + hi + 1) / 2.; Cap accumulations inside ok() to avoid overflow with huge candidates.
- **Pitfalls:** Infinite loops from the wrong mid rounding.; Overflow when summing T / t[i] for T up to 10^18.; Applying it when feasibility is not monotonic.
- **Local judge problems:** [Factory machines](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/factory-time.yaml>) (`factory-time`, medium)

##### Greedy in contests — `cp:greedy-cp`

- **Scope:** Find the sort key, make the safe choice, prove it with an exchange — and use a multiset when choices interact.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/greedy-cp.yaml>); [released atom pack](<D:/Socrat/content/atoms/cp/greedy-cp.yaml>)
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:greedy`, `cp:fast-io`
- **Key points:** Greedy = right sort order + safe local choice + exchange-argument proof.; Pair extremes with two pointers; best-available matches with a sorted multiset.; The adjacent-swap comparison often gives the sort key directly.; Stress-test greedy ideas against brute force.
- **Pitfalls:** Trusting a greedy that passes samples but has no proof.; Removing the wrong copy from a multiset (erase(value) removes all copies in C++).; Java primitive-array sort worst cases in hacked tests.
- **Local judge problems:** [Ticket desk](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/ticket-matching.yaml>) (`ticket-matching`, hard)

- **Key points:** Masks are sets - \|, &, & ~ and shifts are O(1) set operations.; sub = (sub − 1) & mask enumerates all submasks; all-masks-all-submasks is O(3^n).; Prefix XOR gives O(1) range XOR; count XOR-k subarrays with a hash map.; Decompose XOR/AND/OR sums bit by bit.
- **Pitfalls:** Forgetting the empty submask in enumeration loops.; Using 1 << i with i ≥ 31 on 32-bit ints.; Operator precedence - & and ^ bind weaker than == in C++/Java.

#### Dynamic programming for contests — `dp-module`

Knapsack, LIS and bitmask DP.

##### Classic contest DPs — `cp:dp-classics`

- **Scope:** Knapsack, coin combinations and LIS in O(n log n) — the DP patterns every contestant must know cold.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/dp-classics.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:dp-2d`
- **Key points:** 0/1 knapsack - capacity loop downwards; unbounded - upwards.; Counting coin sums - sum-outer loop counts orderings, coin-outer counts combinations.; LIS in O(n log n) with tails + binary search (lower_bound for strict).; Check n × W (or n × sum) against the operation budget before choosing a DP.
- **Pitfalls:** Wrong loop order changing what is counted.; Using lower_bound vs upper_bound incorrectly for strict vs non-strict LIS.; Forgetting modulo in counting DPs.

##### Bitmask DP — `cp:bitmask-dp`

- **Scope:** DP over subsets — assignments, orderings and travelling-salesman style problems for n ≤ 20.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/bitmask-dp.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `cp:dp-classics`, `cp:bitmasks`
- **Key points:** dp[mask] (optionally × last element) over subsets replaces n! orderings with 2^n states.; Increasing mask order is a valid DP order.; TSP-style - O(2^n · n²); assignment - O(2^n · n) using popcount as the implicit index.; Fits n ≤ ~20; check memory - 2^20 × 20 longs is 160 MB.
- **Pitfalls:** Memory blow-up with dp[1 << 20][20] of 64-bit values.; Forgetting to skip unreachable states (wasted time and overflow).; Off-by-one between bit positions and 1-indexed items.
- **Local judge problems:** [Shortest study tour](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/shortest-tour.yaml>) (`shortest-tour`, hard)

- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/graph-techniques.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:shortest-paths`, `cp:fast-io`
- **Key points:** Multi-source BFS - enqueue every source at distance 0 first.; 0-1 BFS with a deque replaces Dijkstra for weights in {0, 1}.; Encode extra conditions into the state and search the state graph.; Bellman–Ford handles negative weights and detects negative cycles.; Keep parent pointers to reconstruct paths.
- **Pitfalls:** Running one BFS per source (O(k · (V + E))).; Forgetting that a state may need re-processing in 0-1 BFS when its distance improves.; State spaces too large for memory.
- **Local judge problems:** [Distance to the nearest exit](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/nearest-exit.yaml>) (`nearest-exit`, medium)

##### Minimum spanning trees — `cp:mst`

- **Scope:** Connect every node at minimum total cost with Kruskal (sort + DSU) or Prim (heap).
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/mst.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:union-find`, `dsa:sorting`
- **Key points:** An MST connects all nodes with minimum total weight and has n − 1 edges.; Kruskal - sort edges, add an edge when DSU says it joins different components.; Cut property justifies the greedy choice.; Fewer than n − 1 accepted edges means the graph is disconnected.
- **Pitfalls:** Forgetting to report disconnected graphs.; Sum overflow with 32-bit totals.; Sorting edges by the wrong field.

##### Tree techniques — `cp:tree-techniques`

- **Scope:** Root a general tree, compute subtree DP bottom-up, flatten it with an Euler tour, and find its diameter.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/tree-techniques.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `dsa:binary-trees`, `dsa:graph-traversal`
- **Key points:** Root the tree, then compute subtree values bottom-up in reverse BFS order.; Iterative traversal avoids recursion limits on deep trees.; Diameter via two BFS passes.; Euler tour turns subtrees into contiguous ranges.; Rerooting computes all-roots answers in O(n).
- **Pitfalls:** Recursive DFS overflowing on chain-shaped trees.; Treating the undirected edge back to the parent as a child.; Forgetting 64-bit for sums of distances (can reach ~10^10 or more).
- **Local judge problems:** [Team sizes](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/subtree-sizes.yaml>) (`subtree-sizes`, easy); [Sum of distances](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/sum-of-distances.yaml>) (`sum-of-distances`, hard)

##### Lowest common ancestor and binary lifting — `cp:lca`

- **Scope:** Jump up a tree by powers of two to answer ancestor, LCA and distance queries in O(log n).
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/lca.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `cp:tree-techniques`, `dsa:bit-manipulation`
- **Key points:** up[k][v] is the 2^k-th ancestor; up[k][v] = up[k−1][up[k−1][v]].; Equalise depths with binary jumps, then lift both while ancestors differ.; Distance(u, v) = depth[u] + depth[v] − 2·depth[lca].; O(n log n) preprocessing, O(log n) per query; also solves k-th ancestor queries.
- **Pitfalls:** Not making the root its own ancestor (jumps go out of range).; Too few levels (LOG must satisfy 2^LOG > n).; Recursive DFS for depths on deep trees.
- **Local judge problems:** [Distance queries](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/tree-distance-queries.yaml>) (`tree-distance-queries`, hard)

##### Fenwick tree (Binary Indexed Tree) — `cp:fenwick-tree`

- **Scope:** Point updates and prefix sums both in O(log n), with a dozen lines of code.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/fenwick-tree.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `cp:prefix-difference`, `dsa:bit-manipulation`
- **Key points:** Index i covers a block of length i & −i ending at i (1-indexed).; add climbs with i += i & −i; prefix descends with i −= i & −i; both O(log n).; Range sum = prefix(r) − prefix(l − 1).; Store differences for range-add/point-query; index by value for counting.; Works for invertible operations; use segment trees for min/max.
- **Pitfalls:** Using 0-based indexes (i & −i is 0 at index 0 → infinite loop).; Forgetting to keep a copy of values when "setting" instead of "adding".; Not compressing values before indexing by value.
- **Local judge problems:** [Dynamic range sums](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/dynamic-range-sum.yaml>) (`dynamic-range-sum`, medium)

##### Segment trees — `cp:segment-tree`

- **Scope:** A tree over array ranges that answers range queries for any associative operation with point updates in O(log n).
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/segment-tree.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `cp:fenwick-tree`, `zero:recursion`
- **Key points:** Each node stores the answer for its range; queries touch O(log n) nodes.; Works for any associative operation with an identity element.; Iterative bottom-up version - leaves at size + i, parent i/2, children 2i and 2i+1.; Lazy propagation adds range updates; custom merges answer complex range questions.
- **Pitfalls:** Mixing inclusive and half-open query ranges.; Wrong identity element (e.g. 0 for min).; Recursive implementations that are too slow in Python for 10^5 queries.
- **Local judge problems:** [Dynamic range minimum](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/range-min-updates.yaml>) (`range-min-updates`, medium)
- **Quiz items:** `identity` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `nodes` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `associative` (mcq, difficulty 3/5)

#### String algorithms — `strings-module`

Polynomial hashing and the prefix function.

##### String hashing — `cp:string-hashing`

- **Scope:** Compare any two substrings in O(1) with polynomial rolling hashes — and keep collisions away.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/string-hashing.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `cp:modular-arithmetic`, `zero:strings`
- **Key points:** Prefix hashes make any substring hash O(1) - h[r] − h[l]·B^(r−l).; Equal strings ⇒ equal hashes; unequal strings collide only with tiny probability.; Use a large modulus (2^61 − 1) or double hashing, with a random base.; Combine with binary search for longest-substring style problems.
- **Pitfalls:** Negative values after subtraction (add M before %).; A single 32-bit-sized modulus with many comparisons — collisions.; Character code 0 (use ord(ch) or ch − 'a' + 1, never 0).
- **Local judge problems:** [Longest repeated substring](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/repeated-substring.yaml>) (`repeated-substring`, hard)
- **Quiz items:** `formula` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `collisions` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `zero-code` (mcq, difficulty 3/5)

##### Prefix function and KMP — `cp:kmp`

- **Scope:** Deterministic linear-time pattern matching and border analysis with the prefix function.
- **Files:** [lesson/quiz/resources YAML](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/concepts/kmp.yaml>); no teaching-atom pack
- **Prerequisites:** `cp:string-hashing`
- **Key points:** π[i] = length of the longest proper border of s[0..i].; Computed in O(n) by falling back through borders.; KMP - π of pattern + '#' + text; π[i] == \|pattern\| marks a match.; Smallest period = n − π[n−1].; Exact (no collisions), unlike hashing.
- **Pitfalls:** Forgetting the separator, so matches straddle pattern and text.; Using π[i − 1] instead of π[k − 1] when falling back.; Confusing "proper" border (excludes the whole string).
- **Local judge problems:** [Pattern occurrences](<D:/Socrat/content/courses/cp/problems/pattern-count.yaml>) (`pattern-count`, medium)
- **Quiz items:** `pi-value` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `period` (mcq, difficulty 2/5); `separator` (mcq, difficulty 3/5)

**Native bank totals:** 138 problems; 230 sample examples; 412 hints; 230 public and 1345 hidden cached tests. Every problem has a Python reference and input generator. Only 55 have a brute/small-generator pair and C++/Java authored references. Only 4 have explicit per-language starters; the runtime otherwise supplies generic starters. Two problems record Owner review on 2026-10-13: `echo-reading` and `next-counter`. Other review status is unestablished by these YAMLs.

## 6. External practice bank: sources, subjects and raw tags

| Platform | Unique problems | Easy | Medium | Hard | Locally stored statements/solutions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codeforces | 10485 | 2700 | 2306 | 5479 | 0 |
| LeetCode | 3110 | 693 | 1684 | 733 | 0 |
| CSES | 294 | 51 | 111 | 132 | 0 |

There are 31,464 problem→concept mappings across 13,889 problems. 74 are Striver-A2Z-flagged. 3,096 problems have company counts. These flags/frequencies do not form separate lesson collections or guarantee current employer interview usage.

**Complete individual external entries:** filter `asset_type=external_problem` in [content-inventory.csv](<D:/Socrat/content-inventory.csv>). It includes each ID/title/URL, all mapped concepts and modules, primary concept, platform, difficulty and provider tags. For exact company associations/frequencies, use [content/practice/companies.json](<D:/Socrat/content/practice/companies.json>); the CSV includes all 637 company summaries and their problem IDs.

### Raw external tags / provider subtopics

These are the exact imported tag strings, not additional authored Socrat topics. A problem can have multiple tags, so the counts overlap. Heuristic concept mapping can be broad; large tag counts do not establish equally deep local teaching coverage.

The 279 atom instances have 127 distinct normalized body strings. Shared/template bodies and the same explanation reused as concept/worked content account for part of the difference. This is a literal text-identity measurement, not an automatic judgment of pedagogical redundancy. There are 107 authored interactive checks and 201 language adapter records.

### Language-specific access

| Course | Resources available Python/C++/Java | Lessons containing Python/C++/Java code fences | Quiz code records Python/C++/Java |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Programming from Zero | 42/39/37 | 17/16/16 | 34/18/18 |
| DSA for Interviews | 121/120/120 | 36/36/36 | 11/9/9 |
| Competitive Programming | 61/61/61 | 20/20/20 | 0/0/0 |

Language-neutral resource and atom records can serve multiple language choices. Code-fence counts indicate literal examples present, not proof of compiled/correct translations. No stored course-owned PDF, notebook, audio or instructional video file was found in `content/`; videos, books and visualizers in resources are links. Tracked archived demo `.webm` files are product walkthroughs, not course lessons. Learner-requested AI explainers and lesson variants are runtime features; their private/generated database outputs were not queried or counted as an authored corpus.

Other observed limits:

- Only three course manifests exist. There is no active SQL, Git, web-development, data-science or general mathematics course. Contest math is a module of Competitive Programming. Foundry's synthetic SQL/Git test fixtures are not real published courses.
- Native practice coverage ranges from zero to two concept-linked problems. One topic has zero: zero:scope-and-mutation. 25 concepts have fewer than two. Large external pools do not fill a local unseen/controlled judge-bank requirement automatically.
- 44/74 concepts lack atom packs, including most later DSA/CP material. A stored lesson is not equivalent to a complete released sequence of worked/faded/visual/repair teaching atoms.
- 390 concept quizzes are reused by multiple activity types; there is no distinct authored bug-kind concept quiz (debug atoms are a separate category). No independent psychometric/difficulty calibration or learning-outcome evidence was audited.
- 136/138 native problems lack an explicit review block and lack authored brute/small-generator and C++/Java reference pairs. Current generated-cache validity does not prove all correctness/maximum-input/multi-language quality gates were run.
- 74 lesson files and their quiz items have no per-item source/license/reviewer fields. Resource publisher URLs identify recommended material, not the provenance of local explanation text.
- External sources are primarily recorded as links/metadata. No general indexed licensed article/book corpus is established by these catalog files. Provider robots/ToS/license validity, link health, video availability and mutable-source freshness remain unverified in this audit.
- External topic and implementation mappings are heuristic, not per-record instructional review. Company recency/frequency values are snapshot metadata. The full original Striver curriculum, complete Developer Roadmap prose, and book chapter bodies are not imported local courses.
- The historical launch backlog mentions a different-branch 5,779-record/429-company resource pool under contracts/resource-pool. That path is absent in this checkout; those historical counts are excluded rather than merged with the current bank.
- Counts in legacy product/release documents can differ from executable files. The inventory below is tied to this snapshot's content hashes and commit; it should be regenerated after any content changes.

## 9. Foundry status versus existing content

M0–M2 are implemented; M3 is a local incomplete checkpoint with live indexing disabled and no S4/S5 worker wiring. See [foundry backlog.md](<D:/Socrat/foundry backlog.md>). Automatic first-demand skill discovery/resolution is M4; graph induction/export is M5; review/gates/status/takedown is M6; calibration/report is M7. None of those planned features creates additional current course counts.

The default `.cache/foundry-snapshots` directory was absent at audit time. No live/deployed database, bucket, private `.env` or learner data was opened. Therefore production Foundry source/chunk/embedding/pack counts are **not established by this audit**; they must not be reported as either a verified usable corpus or a verified global zero. Test artifacts and temporary synthetic Foundry data are excluded.

## 10. Validation, reproducibility and inventory file map

Read-only checks passed: authoring schemas, global prerequisite DAG/references, atom-pack schemas/version linkage, runtime catalog loading from existing test caches, source-cache hashes for all 138 problems, external concept references and company problem IDs. The runtime load read 1575 cached tests. Reference programs, generators, importers, LLMs and source fetchers were not executed. No frontend files or learning content were edited; no push was performed.

Active `content/` scan: **446 files** (8,243,452 bytes). Composite SHA-256 of sorted path→file-hash mapping: `df44752d400e12420cb9a15d9d8be21db61df659af1ab338b9e26793c64553ce`. This fingerprint excludes generated caches, fixtures, code and this report. Word counts split on whitespace and include inline code/Markdown. Atom uniqueness collapses whitespace in `body` only. URL uniqueness uses exact stored/resolved URL strings, not semantic page equivalence.

CSV fields include stable record ID, asset type, course/module/concept IDs, primary concept, title, source URL/name/file/revision, storage type, difficulty/languages, word count, recorded rights/review and additional metadata. Section rows reference the parent lesson; company rows are metadata. Source file SHA-256 ties each record to the audited source snapshot. Quiz entries name prompts and source files; no answer keys or hidden-test bodies were exported. Leading spreadsheet formula characters are apostrophe-escaped in CSV string cells; source files remain unchanged.

## 11. Suggested structure for your next content instruction

Specify the course/module/concept IDs to change, desired learning outcomes and subtopics, target learner/language, how many local lessons/quiz items/native problems/atoms are wanted, which external links may be added, source/rights evidence, reviewer/quality requirements, and whether the change is a draft or a release. Keep local authored material, link-only metadata and Foundry-ingested licensed text as explicit separate quantities. This report sets the current baseline; it does not choose new quotas or authorize publishing.

Skipped: external link/license verification, deployed/private corpus inventory, code/compiler execution and pedagogical calibration. Recorded reviews/rights are declarations in the files; missing metadata and incomplete atom/native-bank coverage are documented above.

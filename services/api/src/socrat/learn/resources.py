"""Curated reading, personalised: each learner sees the few resources that fit them now.

Resources are ranked by how well their level fits the learner's band on the concept, by
how helpful other learners found them (Bayesian-smoothed so a single vote cannot swing
it), and by this learner's own history (unhelpful ones sink, already-read ones step back).

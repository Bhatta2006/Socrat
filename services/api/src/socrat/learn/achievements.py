"""Achievements for real skill milestones, derived from learning data (nothing stored).

Each badge marks something a learner did, not time spent clicking: solving problems
(and solving them without hints), clearing checkpoints, finishing a weekly check, and
studying on consecutive days. Count badges report progress so the next one is visible.

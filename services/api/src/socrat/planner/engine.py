"""Turn learner evidence into a roadmap, an activity queue and a day-by-day schedule.

Pure function of its inputs: identical inputs always produce the identical plan,
so every adaptation can be replayed and explained.

The roadmap adapts on its own only in how a concept is taught: pace, which problems,
spaced reviews, and support steps (a worked example, a simpler explanation, a tutor
check-in) when the learner is stuck. Changes to the roadmap itself — repairing a
prerequisite, test-outs, setting concepts aside, trimming for a deadline — arrive here
only as ``Adaptive.overrides`` the learner has already approved (``socrat.adaptive``).

"""Binary-search the learner's knowledge frontier along the prerequisite order.

The course path is topologically ordered, so "knows concept i" is treated as
evidence for the concepts before it. Each probe asks one question; a probe that
lands exactly on a boundary is confirmed with a second question so a single slip
or lucky guess cannot misplace the learner by a whole module.

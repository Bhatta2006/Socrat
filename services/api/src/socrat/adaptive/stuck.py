"""Notice when a learner is stuck on a concept, say why, and pick the next intervention.

Several weak signals together count as stuck; one bad day does not. The intervention
ladder escalates one rung at a time, in two tiers:

- in-concept support (worked example, simpler explanation, tutor check-in) the planner
  adds on its own, because it changes how a concept is taught, not the roadmap;
- roadmap changes (probe prerequisites, repair a prerequisite, set the concept aside)
  which are only ever *proposed*; the learner decides.

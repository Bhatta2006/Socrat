"""Roadmap changes Socrat proposes and the learner decides.

Socrat never changes the roadmap on its own. The planner, the weekly review and the tutor
can only *propose*; a pending proposal does nothing. Accepting applies it to the
enrollment's overrides (or schedule/goal), logs an explained plan revision, and retires
the alternatives in its group. Declining is remembered so the same idea is not re-asked
for a while. All writes happen in the caller's transaction.

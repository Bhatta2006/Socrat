# Socrat

## Run on Windows without Docker

Install Node 22–24 and Python 3.12 or 3.13. Install the pinned dependency manager with `python -m pip install uv==0.12.20`, then run from PowerShell at the repository root:

```powershell
npm ci
./scripts/dev/doctor.ps1
npm run dev:demo
```

Open http://localhost:3000. The command installs locked Python dependencies, migrates a local SQLite database, generates untracked throwaway credentials in `.env.local`, seeds the original sample curriculum and available personas, and starts the API, native execution worker and web app. Ctrl+C stops the demo processes. Python works without optional C++ or Java tools. The doctor prints installation commands for MSYS2 GNU C++20 and Microsoft OpenJDK 21; restart the demo after installing tools. Bash users can run the same npm command or `bash scripts/dev/start-demo.sh`.

This is an explicitly insecure local development sandbox. The coding workspace displays **Local dev sandbox — not secure for untrusted code**. Production still requires the existing Linux gVisor execution host and private HTTPS broker. See the [presenter guide](docs/demo/DEMO.md), [native execution operations](docs/operations/m6-execution.md), and [editor ADR](docs/architecture/adr/0007-code-editor.md).

Socrat is a deterministic-first personalized learning platform. V1 delivers Data Structures and Algorithms preparation for complete beginners, interview learners, and competitive programmers in Python, C++, and Java. The core platform is designed to support additional skill packs after V1 without rewriting learner state, planning, assessment, or analytics.

## Repository status

M0 product validation remains in progress. The product owner authorized a scoped M1 engineering start while retaining the unpassed learner-pilot and human sign-off gates. The repository-side M1 foundation and hosted quality gates are implemented; cloud staging and operational proof remain pending in the [M1 gate](docs/delivery/milestones/m1-gate.md).

On 2 October 2026, the owner chose Google sign-in and deferred the remaining M1 operational work to proceed with [M2 skill-pack engineering](docs/delivery/milestones/m2-index.md). The kernel includes declarative schemas, graph validation, immutable versioning, editorial review/release/quarantine APIs, and DSA/non-DSA fixtures. M0, M1, and the M2 staging/human gates remain unpassed.

M3 onboarding and deterministic routing is implemented locally: reviewed goals, explicit target/language coverage, beginner bridges, version-pinned confirmation, and atomic funnel events. See the [M3 index](docs/delivery/milestones/m3-index.md) and [gate](docs/delivery/milestones/m3-gate.md). Onboarding is enabled in local Compose and defaults off in staging. No real launch content or completed hosted/staging M3 gate is claimed.

M4 adds resumable objective diagnostics, append-only evidence, deterministic learner-state projections, retention/misconception rules, and protected replay/correction/policy/calibration operations. Diagnostics are enabled in local Compose and default off in staging. Implementation-based placement awaits M6; live content and operational/human approvals remain in the [M4 gate](docs/delivery/milestones/m4-gate.md). See the [operations guide](docs/operations/m4-diagnostics.md).

M5 implements the deterministic curriculum and fourteen-day planner, with prerequisite-safe practice selection, immutable decisions/replay, confirmation, feasibility, workload controls, and missed-day recovery. Local Compose enables planning; staging defaults off. Code practice awaits M6 and full learning sessions await M7. See the [M5 index](docs/delivery/milestones/m5-index.md), [gate](docs/delivery/milestones/m5-gate.md), and [operations guide](docs/operations/m5-planning.md).

M6 adds a self-hosted CodeMirror 6 editor, autosave/resume, a durable signed execution broker, quotas, and separate gVisor-only Python/C++20/Java21 workers. Verified Submit results feed learning evidence and diagnostics; Run never changes mastery. Execution stays disabled until attested runtime images, dedicated-host security/load tests, and external review pass. See the [M6 index](docs/delivery/milestones/m6-index.md), [gate](docs/delivery/milestones/m6-gate.md), and [operations guide](docs/operations/m6-execution.md).

M7 implementation includes durable Today sessions, pinned language/track lessons, private objective checks, mixed Competitive timed/upsolve practice, configurable practice penalties, reviewed structural-repair mappings, saved history/local-day expiry, and owned participation/duration exports. Nine-cell inventory and fourteen-day planner audits gate publication of packs declaring session content. An [original limited-pilot draft](docs/operations/m7-limited-pilot.md) and policy proposal are prepared; independent reviews, calibration and deployed acceptance are owner-deferred. Local Compose enables sessions; staging defaults off. See the [M7 implementation status](docs/delivery/milestones/m7-index.md) and [gate](docs/delivery/milestones/m7-gate.md). Deferred M6 gVisor tests remain open.

M8 adds bounded tutoring, curated fallbacks, provider adapters, durable assistance at Submit, dependency fading, fresh-family planning safeguards and a shadow-only advisor. Models remain disabled by default; earlier external gates remain open. See the [M8 implementation](docs/delivery/milestones/m8-index.md), [gate](docs/delivery/milestones/m8-gate.md) and [operations](docs/operations/m8-assistance.md).

M9 adds protected baseline/weekly/final/retention forms, deterministic scoring, independent human review and disputes, atomic assessment evidence, and a reviewed spaced-scheduling policy. The owner authorized repository implementation while inherited release gates remain open. Local Compose enables assessment development; staging defaults off. See the [M9 implementation](docs/delivery/milestones/m9-index.md), [gate](docs/delivery/milestones/m9-gate.md), and [operations](docs/operations/m9-assessments.md).

M10 implements a Today-first evidence dashboard, reviewed schedule/recovery controls, consented in-app reminders with quiet hours, raw code/tutor retention, owned JSON export, and queued account erasure with private receipts and operator cleanup evidence. Local Compose enables the dashboard and reminders; staging defaults off. Independent accessibility and deployed storage/provider deletion acceptance remain pending. See the [M10 implementation](docs/delivery/milestones/m10-index.md) and [gate](docs/delivery/milestones/m10-gate.md).

Future learning capabilities remain disabled until their milestone contracts and tests exist.

## Start here

1. [Documentation index](docs/README.md)
2. [V1 product requirements](docs/product/v1-product-requirements.md)
3. [M0 milestone index](docs/delivery/milestones/m0-index.md)
4. [M0 gate](docs/delivery/milestones/m0-gate.md)
5. [M1 platform foundation](docs/delivery/milestones/m1-index.md)
6. [M2 skill-pack kernel](docs/delivery/milestones/m2-index.md)
7. [M3 onboarding and routing](docs/delivery/milestones/m3-index.md)
8. [M4 diagnostic and learner-state implementation plan](docs/delivery/milestones/m4-index.md)

## Run the M1 foundation

With Docker available:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The local login exists only in development/test. Staging and production settings fail closed unless HTTPS, PostgreSQL, managed OIDC, strong session/metrics secrets, and disabled developer login are configured.

## Validate M0

From the repository root:

```powershell
node --test prototypes/concierge/model.test.mjs
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/validation/test-m0-contracts.ps1
```

Passing automated checks confirms document/contract consistency only. It does not substitute for learner pilots or accountable human sign-off.

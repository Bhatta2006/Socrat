Socrat-original material is covered by [LICENSE](LICENSE). This file lists third-party
material that ships with Socrat or that Socrat depends on.

## Software dependencies

Python dependencies are pinned in `uv.lock` (exported to `requirements.lock.txt`) and
JavaScript dependencies in `package-lock.json`. Each package is distributed under its own
license, recorded in its package metadata. A complete dependency license report has not
yet been produced; generating one (for example with `pip-licenses` and `license-checker`)
is part of the legal review.

## External problem and resource metadata

`content/practice/` stores titles, links, tags and difficulty for problems on LeetCode,
Codeforces and CSES, and links to TheAlgorithms implementations. Problem statements,
editorials and solutions are not stored. Codeforces data comes from its public API.
Socrat links to these sites; their content belongs to their owners.

Learning resources linked from lessons are listed in [ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md).
